# How a request gets served ?

***The server receives the request and processes it. It handles each request individually, although it may process many requests simultaneously. Each request is broken down into a series of steps that together make up the request-handling process.***

### To handle request Procedure
**1. AuthTrans (authorization translation)**
- Verify any authorization information (such as name and password) sent in the request.

**2. NameTrans (name translation)**

- Translate the logical URI into a local file system path.

**3. PathCheck (path checking)**

- Check the local file system path for validity and check that the requestor has access privileges to the requested resource on the file system.

**4. ObjectType (object typing)**

- Determine the MIME-type (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Encoding) of the requested resource (for example, text/html, image/gif, and so on).

**5. Input (prepare to read input)**

- Select filters that will process incoming request data read by the Service step.

**6. Output (prepare to send output)**

- Select filters that will process outgoing response data generated by the Service step.

**7.Service (generate the response)**

- Generate and return the response to the client.

**8. AddLog (adding log entries)**

- Add entries to log file(s).

**9. Error (service)**

- This step is executed only if an error occurs in the previous steps. If an error occurs, the server logs an error message and aborts the process.
